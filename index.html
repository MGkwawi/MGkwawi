        <p>There are two kinds of people in this world.</p>
        
        <p>There are those who seem to ooze Christmas spirit. If you’re one of these, you love everything about Christmas. You look forward to December with anticipation. You love the traditions of this time of year—the smell of pine trees, the feel of a warm cup of cocoa in your hands, the twinkle of little white lights all around your neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Then there is the second group. Those girls whose spirits limp into the Christmas season. Who struggle to embrace the hubbub of this time of year. Who want to keep their eyes focused on Jesus, lying in a manger, but somehow just can’t seem keep their attention there.</p>
        <p>Honestly, I tend to hang out in the second camp. Don’t get me wrong, I love Christmas, but I struggle to dwell on Jesus coming to earth as a tiny babe (the fancy church word for that is the Incarnation). The demands of daily life keep pulling my thoughts out of the manger and on to things that simply don’t matter as much.</p>
        <p>That’s why no matter how many times I’ve heard it, I can’t get enough of the Christmas story found in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. Reading it is like the ultimate treasure hunt—the more I dig, the more gold nuggets I find!</p>
        <p>Whether you’re reading this while listening to Christmas music or feeling more like grumbling, “Bah, humbug!” I hope you’ll join me in revisiting that first Christmas through the eyes of some of the people who were there.</p>
        <p>Grab your shovel, and let’s start digging!</p>
        
        <h3>Hail Mary the Brave</h3>
        
        <p>Mary bursts onto the scene of Christ’s coming birth in Luke 1:26–39. Here’s a quick rundown of what this passage tells us about her.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Mary lived in Nazareth.</li>
            <li>She was a virgin.</li>
            <li>She was engaged to Joseph.</li>
            <li>The Bible doesn’t tell us Mary’s age. Most Bible scholars agree she was likely young, possibly a teenager, due to the fact that she wasn’t yet married.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Mary is minding her own business when the angel Gabriel appears to her. Here is part of the dialogue the Bible records between Mary and Gabriel in Luke 1:28–35:</p>
        <p id="Luke-1">“Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!”</p>
        <p>The Bible says that the angel’s words troubled Mary. I’d be troubled if an angel showed up in the middle of my day, too! Gabriel goes on to explain that Mary will conceive through the Holy Spirit and then lets the secret slip that Mary’s cousin Elizabeth is also pregnant, even though she has been barren.</p>
        <p>Then the angel declares these powerful words: “For nothing will be impossible with God” (v. 37).</p>
        
        <h3>No Impossibilities</h3>
        
        <p id="v">“Nothing will be impossible with God.”</p>
        <p>Let that soak into your heart.</p>
        <p>Churn it around over and over in your mind until a gem emerges.

</p>
        <p>Nothing is impossible with God.<br>There is no challenge you will ever face that is too big for Him.<br>There is no calling He will ever give you that you cannot carry out.<br>There is no mission too huge for Him.<br>There is no obstacle that He cannot obliterate.</p>
        <p>That is the message of Christmas, really. As the story draws us into the manger, we look past Jesus lying in that smelly barn and see the miraculous sinless life He lived. If we keep looking, we see the cross He died on to pay for our sins. If we squint and look a little harder, we see the grave that He rose from three days later.</p>
        <p>Nothing can stop Him. Death cannot hold Him. Nothing will ever prevent Him from demonstrating His love for us and doing His part to reconcile us to the Father.</p>
        <p>When Mary heard that nothing was impossible with God, she said one of the bravest sentences in the whole Bible.</p>
        <p id="Luke-1-38">And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word” (Luke 1:38).</p>
        <p>Here’s the Erin Davis paraphrase:</p>
        <p id="Erin-Davis-quote">I belong to God. I will do whatever He asks me to.</p>
        <p>Why were those words so brave? Think for a minute about what Gabriel was really calling Mary to.</p>
        <p>Though young and unmarried, Mary was going to be a momma. Not just any momma, but the momma of the Savior of the whole world. There is no parenting manual for that. The angel neglected to stick around to tell Mary’s parents the news and wouldn’t tell her beloved, Joseph, until after Mary had to tell him herself. Mary would face rumors swirling around her little town. (Immaculate conception? Yeah, right!) She would have to deal with embarrassment and public humiliation at the same time the pregnancy hormones hit. Then she would have to raise Jesus. (If you think that was always an easy task, check out Luke 2:41–52). Then Mary would watch as her son was put on trial, falsely accused, publicly beaten, and hung on a cross. The Bible says that Mary stood nearby as He died there (John 19:25).</p>
        <p>Sometimes the Lord’s favor feels like watching your boy die an unjust and agonizing death.</p>
        <p>Mary didn’t know what was down the road, of course. But she didn’t press Gabriel for the details.</p>
        <p>She simply said, “I belong to God. I will do what He says.”</p>
        
        <h3>How About You?</h3>
        
        <p>When God calls you to big things (and little things!), do you want assurance that everything will be okay (and feel okay) before you step out in faith? If you feel ill-equipped or insecure, do you disobey or delay?</p>
        <p>Since the Christmas story helps us see that nothing is impossible with God, the next time God asks you to obey, let me encourage you to simply repeat Mary’s very brave words:</p>
        <p id="mary-quote">“Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.”</p>

        <h2 id="christian-longings">When Christmas Meets Your Unmet Longings</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 16.12.2020<br>by Lenna Shepard</h6>
        <img src="https://liesyoungwomenbelieve.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/201216-LYWB-unmet-longings-713x330.jpg" alt="picrure-of-a-woman" width="500">
        
        <p>Christmastime is filled with celebration and joy. We blare the peppy Christmas tunes, indulge in our favorite treats, and decorate our homes to the hilt with twinkling lights and garland.</p>
        <p>But beneath all the festivity, you might be experiencing feelings that aren’t so merry and bright. Sometimes, the holiday season can dig up buried hurts and fears, causing us to feel particularly lonely, depressed, or restless. And perhaps these feelings linger beyond December 25 and hang around well into the New Year.</p>
        <p>A longing to be known . . .<br>to belong . . .<br>to be loved . . .<br>to be appreciated . . .<br>to find relief from pain . . .<br>to be happy again . . .<br>to start over . . .</p>
        <p>Friend, these desires of ours aren’t unnatural or uncommon. You’re not alone in wrestling with those feelings.</p>
        <p>We can take those longings and misdirect them—chasing after things in hopes of finding fulfillment, taking our eyes off Jesus, the Source of true satisfaction (Ps. 107:9). But this longing for deep, true peace was originally woven within us by God Himself. Longings drive us to Jesus. He wants us to find peace and joy in Him (Ps. 16:11).</p>
        <p>The reason we wrestle with these longings throughout our lives is because we’re not yet in the presence of the Jesus, the One who actually embodies peace and joy and love</p>
        <p>Nancy DeMoss Wolgemuth reminds us in Lies Women Believe:</p>
        <p id="nancy-quote">We have to recognize we will always have unfulfilled longings this side of heaven. We just will. The deepest longings of our heart can’t be filled by any created person or thing.</p>
        <p>How can we expect to feel at home in this life when this simply isn’t our home? We will never find anything in this world that will truly ease all our pain or satisfy our longings forever. That’s because God created us for more than what this world can offer.</p>
        <p>C.S. Lewis put it this way: “If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.”</p>
        
        <h3>The Christmas Story and Our Longings</h3>
        
        <p>If you read the Christmas story in the first two chapters of Luke or Matthew, you’ll find a similar theme of longing, waiting, and seeking. It’s what the manger scene story is all about: Jesus left His home and entered into ours to tell us we don’t belong here, to show us the way to our forever home, to grant us eternal joy in His presence (John 14).</p>
        <p>Consider these familiar faces from the narrative and see what drove them to Jesus.</p>
        
        <h3>The Wise Men</h3>
        
        <p>These men left their homes in faith to journey across the known world to seek out a King who would fulfill thousands of years of prophecy. All this because they longed to see Jesus.</p>
        <p>And when they found Him, they gave Him the best they had to offer—not merely gold, frankincense, and myrrh but humble hearts filled with worship and awe (Matt. 1:1–12).</p>
        <p>Sometimes God gives us dreams and goals to inspire us to live kingdom-oriented lives for His glory. But all too often we insert our own agendas and priorities above His—and then feel miffed when our plans get derailed.</p>
        <p>Ask yourself if the restlessness you’re feeling is actually because you’re clinging to selfish desires. Are you willing to surrender everything—to give up your dreams and longings—and humbly worship Jesus?</p>
        
        <h3>The Shepherds</h3>
        
        <p>Their usual routine was interrupted one night by a grand announcement—the birth of a Savior! Somehow they knew this was big news. (Maybe the night sky filled with shining angels tipped them off.)</p>
        <p>The shepherds were bursting with joy at the sight of Jesus, so they proceeded to tell everyone what they had seen (Luke 2:8–18)! Then they went on tour and made megabucks selling copies of their memoirs.</p>
        <p>Well, actually, Scripture simply says the shepherds returned. That’s right. They went back to their sheep in the pasture to faithfully carry out their regular, ordinary tasks. No spotlight, no fame, no money.</p>
        <p>Do you long to do great things for God? Do you wish you could always live on that “spiritual high” you experienced at summer camp or in youth group?</p>
        <p>Sometimes what initially is a genuine motivation to serve the Lord can morph into the desire to promote yourself. It may be that some of your current frustrations are the result of seeking attention or a spotlight.</p>
        <p>Are you willing to repent of this sin of pride and ask the Lord to give you a heart that serves and glorifies Him alone?</p>
        
        <h3>Anna and Simeon</h3>
        
        <p>Scripture describes these two individuals as righteous and devout (Luke 2:22–38). They both spent much of their lifetime serving the Lord and waiting, longing, for the promised Messiah. They did not see their prayers answered until very late in life, and yet they didn’t lose hope as they waited. What an example!</p>
        <p>There may be something you’ve been earnestly praying for—a restored relationship, an acceptance letter, a promotion at work, a new friend, a husband, a new opportunity.</p>
        <p>Whatever it is you’re longing for, are you willing to entrust that desire to God? Will you wait upon the Lord and let Him renew your strength and fill you with hope?</p>
        
        <h3>Handling the Homesickness</h3>
        
        <p>Having unmet longings or feeling discouraged around the holidays (or any day!) doesn’t mean necessarily that you aren’t trusting God. It just means we live in a broken world where hurt and disappointment are always present. But that is why Jesus came—to heal the brokenhearted and bring joy (John 10:10–11).</p>
        <p>Homesickness is really about longing for heaven. Unfulfilled longings are a bittersweet reminder that this world is not all there is. And even in the midst of the hard and chaotic things in life, God’s love for you doesn’t change. He proved that when the Son of God hung on that cross and joyfully suffered and died for you (John 3:16–17).</p>
        <p>So when it feels like your Christmas joy is overshadowed by heartache, rest in Jesus, your Savior. Remember why that little baby boy was born in Bethlehem. Think about the unchanging character of Jesus and why He came (and is coming again!).</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>He is Immanuel, God with us (Matt. 1:23).</li>
            <li>He is Redeemer, the God who saves (Matt. 1:20–21).</li>
            <li>He is Holy, the Son of God (Luke 1:35).</li>
            <li>He is King, the God who rules (Luke 1:31–33).</li>
            <li>He is Shalom, the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6)</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <p>Where do you find comfort in the Christmas story?</p>
        <p>Which names of God or aspects of Christ’s character fill your heart with hope, even with your unmet longings?</p>
